A) Improve the Command line parser with all the bells and whistles, i.e alias options

B) Try to remove that merge function from the launcher, the launcher should have the minimal
amount of code possible that function should probably be in the command line parser

C) Improve how the crawler handles depth! The crawler can now sometimes crash due to too much recursion

D) Improve MySQL5 plugin adding methods such as isRoot (when we get a user from the DB) and if so perform
the getSh3ll method from this plugin, trying to figure out here how we get writable directories. Do
we just feed the app with a list of well known writable directories ? Or do we make discovery ?
Or maybe both ? In my opinion I think that doing both things would be best.
Add these new methods as in the plugin interface hence they will be required for every plugin
