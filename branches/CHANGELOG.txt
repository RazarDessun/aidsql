End luser stuff:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Added crawling capabilities to the application, the application
	can now be feed with a URL and it will crawl it fetching href's
	(and other informations possibily of interest in a not so distant future

	*Added an immediate-mode parameter, meaning, that if you crawl a site, 
	a certain plugin finds a vulnerable spot, it will end right there, not
	processing other pages involved in the site.
	
	*If fed with a non existent page, access forbidden, etc, http code the application
	will inform you about this

For Developers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Everything remains pretty much the same, except for the addition of the crawler class
	to class/aidsql/Crawler.class.php and some other slight changes in the httpAdapter interface
	(getHttpCode), usefull to know if we've hit some place that doesnt exists, etc.
