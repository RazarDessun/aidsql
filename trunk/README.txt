I will be not held responsible for whatever you do with this application. 
Everything you do will count as your own actions, not mine.
After having agreed this, you might use this application
Thanks!

I'm looking for developers, so, if you have a nice PHP skillset I'd be interested in 
having a word or two with you.

PS: If you think you're some kind of h4x0r 1337 guy for just using this application (or even developing it) you really really really shouldnt be using this or even considering joining this project.
