End luser stuff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Added simple shell script which will run aidSQL and do some checking for PHP
	*Added Googling option, you can now google through this application and look up for sites
	Check the googling options in the config file (config/config.ini)
	*Added several configuration options for the crawler
	*You can now save your logs with the --log-save=mylogfile option, be sure not to append the .log
	extension since the application already does this by itself.
	
For Developers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	*All of the functions lurking in the launcher.php file were moved to functions/launcher.functions.php
	*Unique httpAdapter instance, shared by all objects
	*Unique Logger instance, also, shared by all objects
	*Added an "overlaps-with" parameter to the CmdLineParser this was required for the fact of having
	the google option overlapping with the --url option, it kind of works, I really have to sit down 
	and revisit the command line parser.
	*Added a logging class with coloring capabilities / file saving capabilities

End luser stuff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Improved Crawler, now the crawler can accept certain "page types" (extensions) theres a default set in the
	config/config.ini file however you can change that as much as you want

	*Crawler is not likely to crash due to recursion limits anymore. (Please report any bugs you may find!)
	
For Developers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	*Fixed an issue with immediate-mode, it appears that yes in a config file parsed by the PHP native function
	parse_ini_file will return a 1 instead of the string yes, you'd actually have to quote the string in order 
	for it to be String(3) yes

	*Added a method which attempts to find mod_rewrite "fuck ups" (as I like to call them)
	and other URL masking techniques that do seem to exist but they recurse inside, 
	such as http://host/path/other/path/other/path/other, this previously leaded to infinite recursion 
	which made the crawler die badly. I'm not saying it will not crash for other causes right now! ;)

	*Changes in code disposition, added more methods to fine tune crawling, methos such as addOmitPath
	(Which will omit an entire path) and its counter part addOmitPaths which basically takes in an Array
	and performs addOmitPath on each element.

End luser stuff:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Added crawling capabilities to the application, the application
	can now be feed with a URL and it will crawl it fetching href's
	(and other informations possibily of interest in a not so distant future

	*Added an immediate-mode parameter, meaning, that if you crawl a site, 
	a certain plugin finds a vulnerable spot, it will end right there, not
	processing other pages involved in the site.
	
	*If fed with a non existent page, access forbidden, etc, http code the application
	will inform you about this

For Developers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	*Everything remains pretty much the same, except for the addition of the crawler class
	to class/aidsql/Crawler.class.php and some other slight changes in the httpAdapter interface
	(getHttpCode), usefull to know if we've hit some place that doesnt exists, etc.

	*Added special require functions for each of the application's parts
	requireInterface, requireClass and requireParser
